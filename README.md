# RS-RPCA-GA-PY

Python implementation of Seattle University ECE Department Research Team's Template Extraction software.

# TO DO
# Files under RS-RPCA(Fowler)/l1magic/Optimization
tveq_logbarrier.m <br />
tveq_newton.m <br />
tvqc_logbarrier.m <br />
tvqc_logbarrier_rectangular.m <br />
tvqc_newton.m <br />
tvqc_newton_rectangular.m <br />

# Files under RS-RPCA(Fowler)/inexact_alm_rpca/
choosvd.m <br />
inexact_alm_rpca.m <br />

# For the files under PROPACK
instead of implementing this entire directory, I just translated the files at an "as needed" basis. You most likely won't need every file in this directory. My rule of thumb was that if you see a function that you don't recognize in the project or it's not part of the standard MatLab suite, it's most likely in this directory and just implement that file.

# Tips
Almost ALL of the Matlab functions can be found in the NumPy library. <br />
I developed this using Python 3.7.
